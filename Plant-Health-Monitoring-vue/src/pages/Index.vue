         <h5 class="text-grey-7">
            Plants help us to maintain our eco-system. <br />
            Plants have a massive impact on our lives by providing us with food
            as well as by producing oxygen to breathe. <br />
            Plants are the primary source of food for humans. <br />
            Food and Argricultural organization of United Nations estimates that
            upto 40% of food crops are lost due to plant pests and diseases
            anually. This leads to starving of millions of people. <br />
            This is why we came up with an idea of plant recommendation and
            plant disease detector.
